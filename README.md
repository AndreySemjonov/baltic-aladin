# Baltic ALADIN

The ALADIN 2.3 km weather model's wind at Baltic kite spots, as one small JSON
file that a phone app can read.

The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ) publishes ALADIN as open data,
but only as whole-domain GRIB files of 70–80 MB per variable and run. A GitHub
Actions job checks every hour for a new run (four a day), downloads 10 m wind
speed, direction and gusts, reads each spot in [`spots.json`](spots.json) and
publishes the result:

```json
{"model": "ALADIN 2.3 km", "run": "2026-09-30T06:00Z", "updated": "…",
 "times": [1790661600, …],
 "spots": {"pavilosta": {"wind": [2.0, …], "gust": [3.2, …], "direction": [143, …]}},
 "outside": ["haademeeste", …]}
```

- `times`: Unix seconds (UTC), hourly for 72 hours (54 hours for the 18 UTC run).
- `wind`, `gust`: m/s. `direction`: degrees, where the wind comes from.
- Each value is the four grid points around the spot, weighted by inverse
  distance, with no coastal shift. Read this way, the values match the ALADIN
  row of a commercial forecast site for Pāvilosta within about 0.05 m/s (wind
  and gusts, 34 hours compared).
- `outside`: spots beyond the model's area (it ends at about 57.1°N on the
  Latvian coast).

Run it yourself: `pip install eccodes`, then `python extract.py` (newest run) or
`python extract.py 2026093006`.
